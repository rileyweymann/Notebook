Augmented Reality, as explained by Stuart Laing, seems too complicated. The imaginary soundscape seems like an interesting idea, especially with my themes. But how to implement...

Use the Snip tool on my computer to take photos of the model on Sketchfab. It might be better if I got the same exact dimensions and distances for each of them, but I don't see a way of doing that now. It'll have to be a little rough and all over the place, but maybe that'll help with finding different sounds.

Got the screenshots from the remixed model as well, now to transfer the pictures of the original physical statue and poem from my phone.

I love this website. imaginarysoundscape2 can have all the pictures of me I put in it. And the ones of my project...

The faces mostly make tribal chanting, but the light seems to change how they sound?

My tattoos (celtic ravens) come up with the exact same tribal chanting... I wonder which key words are triggering this

The poems are bonkers. They make sensefor a while, then the grammar falters, then the whole thing falls apart. 

HONK HONK STREET is my favourite poem so far. The rest of the noises seem pretty obvious or have some kind of connection. I think when it's confused it just brings up a nonsense poem.

Is there a better way to display these links than github?

I think it's more fun than a tool, but maybe the fun can be useful, even if it's not necessary. Like practice for other ways of thinking.
