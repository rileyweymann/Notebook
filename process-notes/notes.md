Module 2: Transformation/Mixing

Using Music: found sites musicalgorithms.org and SoundData on thebestschools.org

- Neither one is very intuitive, and dropping in my data does not seem to work in its current state. Need to research further. 
- Further research yields no results. The data provided seems to be the issue, as the resources in these websites and the sample data point to other methods working just fine.
- Time is running out, need to switch to MeshMixer

Mesh Mixer:

- Trying to make a statement about colonialism, use African masks? Other Aboriginal Atrefacts? Look through Sketchfab for models
- No models that will work with the softare I have. Terrible graphics card seems to be limiting software options and my statue is not carrying its textures into other spaces.
- Look for other 3D model dumps
- Imperialism as expanded search?
- As far as imperialists go, I suppose other genres could work... film?
- Settled on the largest and most topical use of imperials: Star Wars. Tons of resources - how to mix?

Object Ideas:

- Jabba the Hut? Texture or head replacement?
- R2D2 head?
- Colour similar to star destroyer. Ship?

R2D2:

- Untextured, but easy to fill in. Just sample blues and use page as reference.
- Metalic textures would be best, but time restricts. 
- Take off head and replace. Issues with legs poking through the top of statue
- Armatures? useful later but maybe for now with reference to movement. Could be bad for Sketchfab...
- Need to experiment with weights. Thinking back and trying to remember rules is difficult
- Moves well enough, just need to adjust space
