Module 2: Transformation/Mixing

Using Music: found sites musicalgorithms.org and SoundData on thebestschools.org

- Neither one is very intuitive, and dropping in my data does not seem to work in its current state. Need to research further. 
- Further research yields no results. The data provided seems to be the issue, as the resources in these websites and the sample data point to other methods working just fine.
- Time is running out, need to switch to MeshMixer

Mesh Mixer:

- Trying to make a statement about colonialism, should I use African masks? Other Aboriginal Atrefacts? Looking through Sketchfab for models.
- No models that will work with the softare I have. Terrible graphics card seems to be limiting software options and my statue is not carrying its textures into other spaces. I may have to keep to the complicated and difficult task of using Blender to switch things back and forth. Praying my old model will behave this time.
- Looking for other 3D model dumps online. Free3D.com seems promising, though there are many objects in the wrong format or which require money.
- Imperialism as an expanded search? It could go beyond colonialism and get a similar, if not identical, response. New Imperialism is pretty much the area I was trying to go after, and oppression is all over there. But there is the issue of diverting from my passion behind the lost author of the original piece. 
- As far as imperialists go, I suppose other genres could work... film?
- Settled on the largest and most topical use of imperials: Star Wars. Tons of resources - but how can I mix?

Object Ideas:

- Jabba the Hut? Retexture or head replacement?
- R2D2 head?
- Colour similar to star destroyer. Spaceship?

R2D2:

- Untextured, but easy to fill in. Just sample blues and use the original page as reference.
- Metalic textures would be best, but time restricts how I am able to do this, as well as I remember most texture websites requiring payment. 
- Take off the head of R2 and replace. There are issues with the legs poking through the top of statue, though I think they can be moved of cut off. Ultimately, they are much less important than the body.
- Maybe I could use armatures? Possibly useful later with the videogame, but maybe for now they could help me with reference to movement. Could be bad for Sketchfab... we will have to see how the armatures transfer over. Worst case I have a .blend file apart from the main file.
- I need to experiment with weights. Thinking back and trying to remember rules is difficult. The armatures don't seem to want to parent to the legs.
- Moves well enough after getting the weights right, just need to adjust the space they take up and see if that's an issue.
