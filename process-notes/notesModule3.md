Twine seems too complicated and I can't find any premade code, which would be helpful to get me started.

I have Unity installed... seems complicated but can I use that? It has free assets, so I can pull more then from Twine.

Unity:
- Assets for the sprite and background objects: GothicVania Town
- Assets for mechanics and environment: 2D Platformer Winter
- Assets for Pixel Font: Tripfive
- Assets for Messages: Fantasy Wooden GUI

Tutorials used are too many to menton here, but they will all be in the bibliography. I also have a word document including all of them on my computer.

I downloaded all of the free assets and transferred them all onto Unity, including every piece of background and sample scene. Pulling them onto the scene view and scaling them to create a platformer setting was easy enough, but left me with no character to use and no reference to the artefat... we will see if I can think of something.

Piskel allowed me to make my own sprite for the statue, while I simply adopted the Hat Man sprite from the GothicVania Town pack for the character. Again, dragging them onto the scene is easy enough.

Coding to make the damn character move was NOT EASY. The tutorials I used were for an earlier version of Unity, and there must have been a few differences big enough to make sure that no actual movement could take place. I could switch them back and forth, but not move across any axis. Gotta call in some help...

My friend Stuart Laing, full-time Teaching Assistant for game design at the Vancouver Film School, took a look at the code included in the tutorals I had. We used Discord to share my screen and tried to work out a solution. Unfortunately, and it is possibly my fault, nothing worked. The character would not move and the game was doomed. I hadn't even gotten to the GUI part, which was equally as important. 

I don't have much time. I need something which is completely full of assets and mechanics geared at non-developers.

This is beautiful. Honestly, so easy to use and easy enough to my ends. Super useful.

I made a rough map of Nunavut from memory, complete with random mountains and forests, all pieces from their first layer of tiles. Then, I populated the map with six "settlements," ranging from a few buildings at first to a castle at the end furthest from the starting point. Most were arbitrary decisions, simply for cosmetics.

The tutorials helped immensely, allowing me to understand the way I had to mix tiles and put together events.

A few events were put in front of broken statues, simply with the "add text" option and putting in a passage from the "Inuit Today" poem for each statue. As well, I took screenshots of the faces on my original model, and used the "add photo" option to put a face to each of the statues and having then follow the player by making them continuous. 

Additional maps are there, somewhat similar to the world map, but with many differences and liberties. Objects are used as barriers to force the player into going into a certain house or path, or to bar them from trying to access unplanned areas.

Architecture is important here. Having them progressively get more and more deteriorated means that there will be more significance on the visuals in the narratives and themes.
