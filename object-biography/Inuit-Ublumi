Very Little is known publically about the artist, Peter Karlik, other than that he is a First Nations artist from the Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, and that his carvings are displayed in museums and galleries across Canada. The only immediately available biography and as well description of the art in question is as follows: 

"Pierre Karlik
Inuit
Rankin Inlet, Nunavut Territory, Canada
(1931- )


Pierre was commissioned in 1974 by the National Museum of Man, Ottawa to create a sculpture personifying the lifestyle of contemporary Inuit; the unveiling took place in September 1976." (INAC, 1997)


He was born in Nunavut, but spent some time in Manitoba when he was diagnosed with Polio at a young age (citation). It is imjportant to understand that this is where many Inuit really integrated with Western culture
