The game created from the original //Inuit Ublumi// model takes a very divergent path in trying to display the themes behind it. For one, the process chosen reduced it to a 2D digital world, accompanied with music and text. Its simplicity is what drew me to the process. 
The player controls a sprite whose sole purpose is simply to move on the path through a pixelated Nunavut and encounter the ruined statues, which speak and are reborn as the player gets within a tile of them. Each statue provides a piece of the //Inuit Today// poem which accompanied the original statue in the Canadian Museum of History. 
Small fictional villages "evolve" as the player progresses, becoming larger and made out of grander and more permanent materials, though each also getting progressively more worn down. The perversion of values and of society by colonial forces are evident in both the poem and as well the architecture in this way.
