  The original Inuit Ublumi statue holds significance for its commentary on the evolution of a post-colonial society and its personal relationship with its governing body. The perception by the indigenous community, that it represents a measure of trust and understanding, as well as a history of involved political participation by the territory, is in contention with other perspectives, as well as the execution of its representation by the Canadian History Museum. 
  
  Its creator has used the medium to express his view on the shifting values of the Inuit peoples, and as well his apparent sadness with their distance from traditional values, as expressed in the poem in the "Inuit Ublumi" section of the biography. 
  
  
  R2D2, on the other hand, is a creation of George Lucas for the Star Wars films. His history is described on StarWars.com as follows:
  
"A resourceful astromech droid, R2-D2 served Padm√© Amidala, Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker in turn, showing great bravery in rescuing his masters and their friends from many perils. A skilled starship mechanic and fighter pilot's assistant, he formed an unlikely but enduring friendship with the fussy protocol droid C-3PO."

  He is a key point in the major storylines of the cinematic universe, and is linked to the major themes within. The Empire is the main antagonist in the original series, and the opposition to those oppressive forces is what drives the story along. Imperialism is something that the Inuit know all too well, and it is a loose tie to the model. The narrative of the piece shifts from the forward movement of the peoples, or their society's evolution, and the original author's intent and forgotten identity, to one where the oppression of the North and the regressive perspective is more highlighted. 
  
  Perhaps from understanding the shift in narrative will give a more clear picture o how the Inuit fit into the past, present, and future, or the hidden and the mainstream when the two seemingly opposite models. It is important to view things as pieces of each other, as well as a whole. It allows one to take in the history and separate stories, and then compare and contrast to find themes that may not have been immediately visible.
