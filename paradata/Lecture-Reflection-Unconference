"Unconference"

  Of all the work we've done in this class, I'd say that the most intriguing and rewarding had to be when we reflected on what we had been reading and speaking about un the unconference format. There were many subjects which were brought forward for discussion, though only four were picked when it came to actually splitting off and sharing our thoughts. From the following list of contenders, only the last four were chosen:

- Trial + error: collaborative possibilities (6)
- Virtual archaeology (0)
- Philosophy of replicants (1)
- Module 2 (0)
- Digital History in the Wild (8)
- Accessibility of Virtual Reality (9) and Ethics/laws (8)
- Software (8)
- Video games + education (15)

  I know very little about software and hisory in video games, which were in the first and second brackets, so I sat in forthe DH in the - Wild and Accessbility and Ethics for my discussions, which I think yeilded a much better conversation for what I had wanted to accomplish.

  It should be said that we didn't adhere to all of the ideas of an unconference, particularily the law of two feet, which encouraged those perhaps participating less in the conversation to change and move into the other group. There was very little change, even when switching brackets and addressing a new topic. Both groups seemed content to make the shift tothe new subject, which in this case was fairly parallel to the previous discussons. It could be argued that this is true for basially any of the possible choices, as it's all connected when you're talking about theories and vague predictions for the future of an all-encompassing field, but that seems a bit dramatic when you have people discussing software and videogames or ethics and evolution.

  The reason I have decided to put this with the data on my sculpture is twofold: it has everything to do with reimagining and remixing ideas, and it is a model of an object which has been lost in plain sight, yet I have an opportunity to help it evolve through digital history. We moved through a range of topcs, from digital history's use in the classroom to the bodies that influence its development and future. Changing the context of its purpose and understanding the barriers in its way makes for the reinterpretation of its parts more easily done, and leads well into the second module.
