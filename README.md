HIST 3812: Digital History


Module 1

Task: Create a digital copy of an artefact, site, or building, from the Ottawa area.

First steps: Find a subject to use for the photogrammetry portion of this module. I chose to use the Android app Scann3D because it was the most convenient to my schedule.

From January 17th to Jan 24th, I spent approximately 10 hours trying to find a subject that would work with the app, foolishly being too stubborn to take perfectly good models and using a computer-based program toremove the backgrounds, which were the main issue in capturing subjects outside. I attempted to capture subjects at Major's Hill Park, Parliament Hill, City Hall, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the National Art Gallery, Jack Purcell Park, Library and Archives Canada, and finally at the Canadian Museum of History, where I found a subject which the app could work with.

The main issue was the background of the photos. I could not capture more than a head or part of a torso of statues if there was any kind of tree or pointed building within sight. The rest was lost or assumed to be part of the surroundings.

Subject: Inuit Today

Inuit Today was the only artefact in the Canadian History Museum which one could easily walk around in its entirety, though the top of it was not easily seen as it was raised. After such a long time searching for a subject, it seemed like a good idea to go with the only viable option. Lighting was also an issue here, as certain spots were not illuminated, and parts of the backgroud were. For this reason the model looks distorted and odd. But again, no other suitable candidate had been found, and so the model had to be used. 
Holes where my camera couldn't see were patched in Blender, though technical issues meant that the texture could not be applied until I tore apart the files to get at the .mtl file, which was not behaving well with the .obj file. The texture would not map itself to the object, and it took considerable guesswork to make it appear, only in its fully rendered state. Meshlab seemed like the only program which could solve this, though I am lead to believe that my decade-old laptop lacks the graphics card necessary to run it properly, and the model is thusly either incomplete or has a low resolution and difficult path to proper exporting in its Blender incarnation.
